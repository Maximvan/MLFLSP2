# Machine Learning for Life Sciences Project 2 - Multi-Label Protein Organelle Localization Prediction

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to predict the localization labels of protein organelles for each sample in a dataset containing images obtained through confocal microscopy. The dataset encompasses 10 distinct labels representing various protein organelle localizations. It is crucial to note that the dataset includes 10 different cell types, each exhibiting highly diverse morphologies, which directly influence the protein patterns of various organelles. Images within the dataset may have one or more labels associated with them.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a model capable of predicting, for a given image the classes determining one or more proteins. This problem is framed as a multi-label classification challenge, and the mean F1-score is selected as the evaluation metric. The project is the second and final project as part of the course Machine Learning for Life Sciences at Ghent University.
